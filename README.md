# Artemis
**Build dart types from GraphQL schemas and queries**

## Read before use
This package removes the Artemis client and only use the code generator from the original library. Improvements are made to suit my projects so don't expect it to be good. All credits go to the author of the [original package](https://github.com/comigor/artemis)
